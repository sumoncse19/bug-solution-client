Originally from Poland, lived in France, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, before moving to Sao Paulo in Brazil a few years ago. Moving from one country to another with my family (with three children) gave me a deep understanding of the challenges of expatriate life, but also the opportunity to learn about many cultures and develop my language, interpersonal and therapeutic skills not only thanks to the opportunity to work with people from different parts of the world and from different cultures, but also thanks to the opportunity to train alongside various specialists from different countries.",
    "about_desc_2": "I have obtained a Master in Clinical Psychology from the University of Paris 8 (France), and also completed full Jeffrey Young's Schema Therapy training, three levels of EMDR training, including EMDR for complex trauma, and Emotional Freedom Technique trainings, and received several workshop certificates in these subjects. I hold as well an Advanced Practitioner Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy from London College of Clinical Hypnosis in Asia (accredited by the University of West London, UK).",
    "about_desc_3": "In parallel to developing my psychotherapeutic skills in a more classical, traditional sense, I developed my interest in the broadly understood expansion of consciousness, various methods of working with energy (including Reiki or Tantra), various meditation and affirmation techniques, as well as regression (hypnotic and non-hypnotic).",
    "about_desc_4": "I hold a membership of the British Society of Clinical Hypnosis (BSCH) and the International Society of Schema Therapy. I am also a member of Psy Expat network and of Syndicat National des Psychologues in France.",

    "ascent_u_come_about_description1": "<strong> On the one hand,</strong> out of a desire to work with <strong> mental health, well-being and personal and spiritual development in the broadest sense. </strong> Out of a desire to help people find balance and inner peace, joy and serenity, by first of all learning self-acceptance and self-love. We offer help to heal the past and unlock inner potential to allow a person to grow, so that they can self-realise and create their life as they wish.",
    "ascent_u_come_about_description2": "<strong> On the other hand, </strong> studying psychology and then various forms ofpsychotherapy and energy work, as well as working with patients for many years, has shown us that <strong> a person should be approached holistically, </strong> that the best results are obtained by taking the person as a whole and combining different techniques. Knowing also that we have different bodies (in simple terms: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual) that are connected and interact with each other, wedecided to offer <strong> our holistic approach.</strong> It includes a combination of classical psychotherapeutic   techniques with mindfulness, meditation, hypnosis,   breathing   techniques, psycho-energetic, energetic and quantum techniques <strong> (Energy Psychology). </strong> At the same time, we promote and   encourage <strong> physical activity </strong> and <strong> contact with nature </strong> as well as <strong> healthy eating, </strong> as we recognize the important role they play in our mental health. We would like to add here that our activities are also inspired by the contents of the book  A Course in Miracles, in the works of David R. Hawkins, Eckhart Tolle and Joe Dispenza.",
    "ascent_u_come_about_description3": "We believe that <strong> the foundations of therapy and self-work are to understand that our thoughts and beliefs create our reality, and to learn self-acceptance and self-love. </strong> This makes it possible to connect with our Authentic Self, and paves the way to a life of success",
    "ascent_u_come_about_description8": "",
    "ascent_u_come_about_description4": "Success is understood here as health and energy, emotional and mental balance,   contentment   and   lasting   joy,   successful   interpersonal relationships, freedom to create, peace of mind, as well as success in professional and material life. Success is abundance, life with passion and the ability to achieve goals and fulfil desires with ease and effortlessness.",

    "ascent_u_come_about_description5": "When you don't accept and love yourself, or when you don't accept and love some part of yourself, some aspect of yourself, you feel shame, and consequently you feel fear. Fear that someone will discover your faults, that someone will discover that you are not good enough, will judge you. You become sensitive to criticism. You feel the fear of rejection, the fear of failure, you believe that you don't deserve to be loved. More often than not, we are much more aware of the presence of fear than of shame, which hides much deeper in our psyche.",
    "ascent_u_come_about_description6": "When we remain in the low vibrations of shame, guilt, sadness, grief and fear everything is difficult, life seems a constant challenge and even a struggle, we feel overtired, stressed, often lonely and unhappy. We often feel that we have to be perfect, that we have to prove something to someone or to ourselves and our search for happiness and fulfilment is never-ending: there is always one more project to complete, one more problem to solve before joy becomes attainable. We often look to others for approval, for confirmation of our worth. We expect recognition from them and become even more vulnerable because we make our happiness depend on their reaction and behaviour. In this way, we give other people, situations and institutions too much power over us. So we can start to feel like victims: victims of the system, of fate or of other people. We think others are taking advantage of us, underestimate us, dislike us, reject us, or that we are inferior to them in one respect or another. It seems to us that fate does not favor us, the world is against us and life is hard. Most often, these are just our own <strong> projections, </strong> stemming from our <strong> beliefs and convictions. </strong>",
    "ascent_u_come_about_description7": "Therefore, <strong> our mission is to help people get out of the low vibrations of shame and fear and raise their level of consciousness by learning to accept and love, </strong> first themselves and then others. We want to help people get out of limiting schemas and <strong> beliefs </strong> that, although they do not make them happy, paradoxically create a so-called comfort zone. <strong> We want to help people find the courage to overcome their fears and step out of their comfort zone, to create a new, better reality, a new life, one they desire and in which they are accompanied by success:</strong> health, balance, passion, abundance, success, joy and peace. Achieving this becomes possible, as we wrote above, by raising the level of consciousness and connecting with our Authentic Self. Through learning a new way of perceiving ourselves, others and the world around us. Through learning love and acceptance. Through knowing that we deserve the best. At this level we are Pure, Universal Consciousness, the Universe. We know that <strong> we are all one.</strong> ",

There is an all-embracing love felt as peace, timelessness, realisation, contentment, motionlessness, completion. There is inner silence and light, a sense of total freedom and at the same time unity and connection. This is what we aspire to and wish for everyone!",
    "other_values_inner_peace_end": "To be happy, you must first be able to love and accept yourself. No one else will make us happy. To be able to overcome fear, to be fully realised and to live the life we want, you first have to accept and love yourself. To be able to love others you first need to be able to love yourself. In order to be able to create a healthy relationship with anyone, a relationship based on love rather than a sense of lacking, self-sacrifice and fear, you first have to know how to love yourself. Through love, everything flourishes. It brings us together and opens us up to others. A self-loving person  is  happy, generous, supportive, forgiving and can be relied upon. They are a better partner, parent, friend... Your greatest contribution to the well-being of humanity is therefore your happiness!  <strong>  When one of us loses, we all lose; when one of us gains, we all gain. </strong>",
    "other_values_energy": "We also want to mention here the importance of <strong>energy.</strong> The energy that we are all made of, as is the entire world around us, nature and the Universe. The energy with which we are connected to the Universe, to everyone, to everything.",

    "person_description1": "My name is Marta Golaszewska-Gilbert and I am an <strong> energy psychologist. </strong> I am originally from Poland but have lived abroad for over 20 years. I lived in France, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore before moving to Sao Paulo, Brazil a few years ago. Currently, I divide my time and life between Brazil and Europe. Moving from one country to another with my family (with three children) gave me a deep understanding of the challenges of expatriate life. But most of all, it has given me the opportunity to learn about many cultures and develop my linguistic, interpersonal and therapeutic skills, not only through the opportunity to work with people from different cultures and parts of the world, but also through the opportunity to learn alongside many professionals from different countries.",
    "person_description2": "I am a qualified clinical <strong> psychologist, psychotherapist, hypnotherapist and energy healer. </strong> I obtained my Master's degree in <strong> clinical psychology </strong> in France at the University of Paris 8. I then studied various forms of therapy to acquire the tools necessary for my profession. Thus, I completed training in Jeffrey Young's <strong> Schema Therapy, </strong> three levels of <strong> EMDR  </strong>(Eye   Movement   Desensitisation and Reprocessing) training, including EMDR used in the treatment of complex trauma, and training in Emotional Freedom Techniques <strong> (EFT)</strong> . I hold an Advanced Practitioner Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy from the London College of Clinical Hypnosis (accredited by the University of West London, UK). Additionally, I have completed training in the   following therapies: cognitive-behavioural, solution-focused, ego states, humanistic (in particular Irvin Yalom) and <strong> Mindfulness. </strong> I have studied <strong> Carl Gustav Jung</strong>'s theories particularly closely and perfected dream interpretation.",
    "person_description3": "Despite being familiar with so many different approaches and types of therapy, I had the feeling that I was missing something, so in tandem with developing a psychotherapeutic practice in the more classical, traditional sense, I have developed knowledge and skills in the field of broadly understood <strong> expansion of consciousness, quantum psychology, </strong> various methods of <strong> working with energy, meditation </strong> and <strong> manifestation </strong> techniques, as well as <strong> regression </strong> (hypnotic and non-hypnotic).",
    "person_description4": "<strong> In my work, </strong> which has become my passion, I therefore combine classical psychotherapy with energy and quantum techniques to offer a holistic approach, encompassing all the human bodies (in simple terms physical, mental, emotional and spiritual). My practice is also inspired by the content of the book <strong> A Course in Miracles,</strong> of the works of David R. Hawkins, Eckhart Tolle and Joe Dispenza.",
    "person_description5": "My other great passion is <strong> nature and trekking, </strong> especially <strong> mountain trekking.</strong> I have had the opportunity to hike numerous wonderful trails and climb many beautiful mountains in Asia, Europe and South America.",
    "person_description6": "Because I know how important and beneficial physical activity is for physical and mental health (see â€˜Be physically activeâ€™), and I have always wanted to combine my two passions, I organise <strong> Trips to U </strong> that include psycho-energetic workshops and trekking in nature. <strong> Take a journey into yourself and a journey into the Universe! You are warmly invited! </strong>",
    "person_description7": "I work in English, French and Polish. I am a member of the British Society of Clinical Hypnosis (BSCH) and the International Society of Schema Therapy (ISST). I am also a member of the French Psy Expat network and the National Association of Psychologists in France."
